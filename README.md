## Tableau Embedding Project

## aim:
To learn how to embed Tableau dashboards into a webpage. 








## thoughts, notes and randomness

After successfully uploading my code I needed to figure out how I could actually view the webpage I had create (not just the html code).

Within the repo, go to Settings (the last tab) and Options (this is top of the list so should be open automatically.
Scroll down to Git Hub Pages
Select Master Branch from the drop down.
This creates a webaddress to view your repo. The address appears in green above the GitHub Pages Section within settings.
For example, to view the webpage created as part of this Tableau Embedding Project go to:
